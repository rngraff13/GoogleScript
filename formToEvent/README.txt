The .js file in this directory contains two functions. These two functions work together in order to 
create a new google calendar event based on responses to a google form*.

I created these functions in order to make an automated reservation scheduling form on a website.
For my specific problem, there were multiple rooms that could be reserved. Only one person could have 
a room reserved at a time. For this, I created a google form that asked for a name/ID, the name of the
requested room, and the start and end dates and times for the requested reservation. If the room is available for the requested time, the reservation is made and appeals on the proper google calendar. For this, separate calendars had to be made for each room.


*Based on a different google form, some changes to these functions may be necessary.
